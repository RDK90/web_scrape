# Text Scraping and Classification 

The objective of this script is to scrape a corpus of news articles from a set of web pages, pre-process the corpus, and evaluate the performance of automated classification of these articles.

This script uses a number of external python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Sklearn, Matplotlib and NLTK, which will all be explained as they arise in the solution.
